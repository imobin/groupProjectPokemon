# Pokémon Explorer

This project was developed as a practice exercise to strengthen our skills in team collaboration using **Git** and **GitHub**, as well as to enhance our understanding of **dynamic HTML generation with JavaScript** and **working with APIs**. Special thanks to Khaled Alabssi for leading the group.

We used the [Pokémon API (PokeAPI)](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve and display data about various Pokémon.

## 🔧 What We Practiced

- Collaborating in a team using **Git version control**
- Creating dynamic web content using **JavaScript**
- Consuming external data using **APIs**
- Managing **local storage** to maintain user preferences

## 🚀 Project Features
